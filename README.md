# Bankers-Algorithm---OS
This is the code for Banker's Algorithm of Operating System.
It will help finding whether the system is in safe state or not and if it is then it would give the safe sequence otherwise appropriate error message would be displayed.
This code can be used for OPerating System assignments as it is very easy and simple to understand. 
I hope it helps :)
